Now we will serve a more stylish site

We copy a stylesheet from Bootstrap Official [Website](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Note that we modified and added button and fields so we could use the website.

Also, I decided to use an `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded')` insted of `jQuery` because I think it would be more modern way and that was the way I knew how to do it. At least that's what I thought...
